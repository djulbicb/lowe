# AI for Everyone
## Week 1
ANI - Artificial narrow intelligence
AGI - Artificial general intelligence
Supervised learning - Input, Output - Requires a lot of data

Data can be acquired:
- manual labeling
- from observing behavior
- download from website/partnership

Data can be messy:
- usually the more data the better BUT
- Garbage In, Garbage out
- Incorrect labels, missing values
- multiple types of data. 
- Call ai team before and during data collecting

### Machine learning vs Data Science vs Deep Learning vs AI:
#### AI > Machine Learning > Deep Learning

- **AI** is broad field that encompasses machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, robotics.
Performs tasks that requires human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, decision-making, and language understanding.
- **Data Science** - is extracting knowledge or insight of data. Summarizes conclusions. ie. newly renovated house give 15% more revenue, and houses with same.
- **Machine learning** - gives computers the ability to learn without being explicit programmed. Often using statistical methods, linear regression, decision trees, and clustering. ie. will find ads for customers they may click,
- **Deep Learning** - Focused on Neural network - more complex that traditional machine learning 

The main difference between DL and ML is the complexity of the models that they use to learn from data.

### Difference between Internet company and Shopping mall + website
- A/B testing
- Short iteration time
- Decision pushed down to engineers
### Difference between AI company and Any company + DL
- Strategic data acquisition
- Unified data warehouse, so teams can connect dots
- They have specific people in this role
### Transform company to AI company
- Execute pilot projects
- Build an in-house AI team
- Provide broad AI training
- Develop an AI strategy
- Develop internal and external communications

### What ML can do
Rule of thumb if you need less of a second to come up with a conclusion to an issue,
is this spam, whats the price, whats on picture... ML can do it.
- Can do: Self driving cars, where are other cars
- Cant do: Human gestures for a car - police man, hitchhiker, bike turns signal... Cant deduce intention
- Can do: Based on 10k images diagnose pneumonia
- Cant do: Based on medical textbook 10 images, cant figure out while medical doctor can

ML will have problem if there is:
- difference in quality of data, ie different xray machines, one produces noise. (perform on new data)
- learning new concepts on small amount of data
