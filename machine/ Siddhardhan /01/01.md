# AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
AI is branch of Computer science that focuses on building smart and intelligent machines
non-intelligent: bike
intelligent machines: smart car, google assistant. Make decisions themselves

Machine Learning is technique of AI that can learn from data without explicitly programmed.
ML learns from the data, we dont tell exactly.

Deep Learning is subfield of ML that uses Neural Networks to learn from the data.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. **Supervised** - Labelled data
   - Example: Grouped pics mangoes and apples are labeled and given to ML model. 
   - Result: Model is able to take input image and determine if its an orange or apple 
2. **Reinforcement** - is area of ML how intelligent agent take actions in environment to maximize its rewards.

    There are 4 aspects:
    Agent in environment will do action and get rewards for it.
    PC (Agent) will play chess. And for each step gets reward. Games, autonomous system like car and drones are based on reinforced learnin.
  - Environment
  - Agent
  - Action
  - Reward
3. **Unsupervised** - Unlabelled data
- Example: Ungrouped images of apples and images. ML model will determine groups
