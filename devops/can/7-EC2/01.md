# Virtualization 101 
Enables IAAS - infrastructure as a service

Virtualizacija je pokretanje vise OS na jednom serveru.
Ranije je hardwer mogao da pokrene jedan proces, tako da pokretanje vise OS bi kreshovalo.

Virtualizacija je u pocetku bila softwerska. 
- Emulated virtualization - Software had hypervisor, and was running virtual machine with virtual allocation. Hypervisor was running process binary translation and was manipulating guest OS commands.
- Para-virtualization - Instead of hypervisor. Source call is modified to call hypervisor using hyper-calls. Special modified OS were used hypervisor. OS is kinda aware of virtualization
- Hardware assisted virtualization - CPU is aware of virtualization, and hypervisor communicates directly with CPU.
- SR-IOV - Single root virtualization - allows hardware (ie. network card) to represent itself as multiple cards. So no translation happens at hypervisor. Hardware is aware of virtualization.

AWS uses advanced hypervisor stack called Nitro which enabled EC2 features.
In EC2 this is called enhanced network.

## EC2
Its a virtual machine (OS + Resources). They run on EC2 Hosts, psychical servers.
Hosts can be **shared** and **dedicated**.

Hosts run in AZ. So EC2 is AZ resilient.
AZ have resource but also local storage **instance store**. But this is on instance and if gets moved to another host, storage is lost.

2 Types networking - Reliant on host in AZ:
- storage networking
- data networking

Elastic Block Store - EBS
Also running in instance. Here you can allocate volumes.

If you restart instance, it stays on host.
But if you stop and start, or instance is broken - That will move to another instance but same AZ.

You can migrate via snapshots and IAM. 
You cant cross AZ.

#### EC2 is good for
- Traditional OS+Application
- Good for application if you have certain configuration you need
- Good for Long-Running Compute requirements
- Server-style application waiting for incoming connections
- that need burst or steady state load requirements.
- Monolithic application stacks
- Disaster recovery

For other needs there stuff like 
- elastic container service 
- lambda.

### EC2 Types of instance
Exam question: C type is better than M type
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- https://ec2instances.info/

Different types of performance:
- Raw CPU, Memory, Local Storage capacity & Type
- Resource ratios for different needs
- Storage and Data network Bandwidth
- System architecture/vendor

EC Categories
- General purpose - default, diverse workload, equal resource
- Compute Optimized - media processing, HPC, scientific modeling, gaming, ML
- Memory optimized - large in-memory databases
- Accelerated computing - Hardware GPU, programmable gate arrays FPGA
- Storage Optimized - Sequential and Random I/O

Instance type: **R5dn.8xlarge**
- **R** - Instance family for type of computing
- **5** - Generation. C4 is 4th generation, but now its 5. Usually better performance. Pick latest if you can, if available in AZ.
- **8xlarge** - instance Size, micro, large... Better larger number of smaller instance sizes. Sizes: nano, micro, small, medium, large, xlarge.
- dn - additional capabilities. ie n network optimized. a - amd cpu, d os NVMe storage, e - extra capacity

# SSH vs EC2 Instance Connect
## SSH Client

### Connect with EC2-Connect and SSH and remove EC2 connect with security group
1. Make sure ssh key exists. Must be ec2 key
```
EC2>Key pairs>Create key pair
A4L, .pem
click one-click deployment link
```
![01-02-ec2-create-key-pair.png](./img%2F01-02-ec2-create-key-pair.png)

2. New istance is created. Go to instance > Connect
3. `ssh -i "linuxec2.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-242-194-36.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
4. Stack > Resources > Find security group > Edit inbound rules
- Find ssh, which has `0.0.0.0/0` and delete item
- In dropdown set MyIP
- try to reconnect to ssh and it will work
- but EC2 Connect wont work

### Connect only with EC2-Connect and block ssh

- Find ip range for service and regions https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json
```
{
  "ip_prefix": "18.206.107.24/29",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "service": "EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT",
  "network_border_group": "us-east-1"
}
```
- Replace ip address for ssh rule  
  ![01-03-ec2-security-group.png](img%2F01-03-ec2-security-group.png)
- Try to connect with EC2-Connect, works
- Try with ssh. fails

Using cli you can connect with private ec2 instance using vpn or direct connect.
GUI you can use to connect to public. Session manager doesn't have limitation.

## Storage Refresher
### Different ways of connecting storage devices to servers or networks
- Direct Attached Storage (DAS)  - directly attached to hardware - ie instance store. if something fails then data lost
- NNetwork Attached Storage (NAS) - volumes delivered over network

### Based on persistence:
- ephemeral storage - temporary - instance store. When the instance is terminated or stopped, the data stored in ephemeral storage is lost.
- persistent storage - network attached delivered by Elastic Block Store (EBS) or Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) in AWS

### Different storage paradigms:
- Block storage - volume presented as collection of blocks. No structure, mountable, bootable
creates file system over block storage as C drive or root volume
block can be psychal media or as a logical volume which is backed by psychal
block storage is a system of storage block, no structure so OS has to create it.
- File storage-
presented as a file share. has structure. Mountable, not bootable
- Object storage - flat collection of objects. Not mountable, not bootable. Objects can be anything.
for large collection cause infinite scalable

Attributes - storage performance
IO block size - 16k, 64k, 1MEG...
IOPS - input operations per second - how many read/writes per second. Some media types are better at IOPS and some at throughput 
Throughput - how many data per second - XX MB/s

IO * IOPS = Throughput
some systems have throughput limits


# EBS
uses block storage. Raw disk allocation (volume). Can be encrypted by KMS
Instance sees block and create a file system
EBS is AZ resilient.

Some storages can multi attach to multi ec2 system. 
Usually single.
Can be attached and detached. And backup to s3 as snapshot. Snapshot is region resilient.
Billed based by GB per month

EBS volumes type
GP2 and GP3 - General purpose
An IO Credit is 16KB
IOPS assume 16KB
1IOPS in 1 IO in 1 second

IO credit bucket
bucket fills with 100IO credit/s
beyond that is 3x IO per second per 1GB. but it can go burst 3000IOPS by depleting
all volumes get 5.4 million great for boots and initial workloads

Boot volumes, low latency interactive app, dev & test


GP3 uses 3000IOPS & 125MiBs - gp3 is cheaper

- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/2 and block express)
> Fale statistika
> 

EBS - HDD storage
Slower. 2 types
st1- throughput optimized. where data writtern read in sequantial

## instance store volumes
fizicki povezani sa ec2 host
instance na tom hostu mogu im pristupiti
highest storage performance
included in instance price
attached at launch
block storage device
temporary

## Instance store vs EBS
- ebs is more persistent, resilient
- storage isolated from lifecycle - Ebs
- resilience with built in replication - both
- high performance - both
- super high performance - instance
- cost - instance store

EBS - cheap - ST1 SC1
Throughput - ST1
Boot - not st1 or sc1
GP2/3 - up to 16k iops
IO 1/2 up to 64k iops - there se io 2 block express 256k with large instance types

Raido + multiple ebs up to 260k with large isntance

more than 260k than instance store

EBS snapshot are stored in s3 so data becomes region resilient.
snapshot is incremental, first is full data
future snapshots are incremental and consume less space
- usually if incremental backup fails all future would break. EBS is fine with this 
Volume can be created from snapshot and copied between regions
- snapshots restore lazily - fetched gradually
- you can force ebs to pull data from s3 - but now you can do fsr (fast snapshot restore) 
- 50 fsr for a region and costs extra


# EBS
block storage delivered by network.
